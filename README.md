# HW1 2048
  In this lab, you will learn temporal difference learning (TD) algorithm by solving the 2048 game using an ùëõ-tuple network.
  Experimental Results
    (1) A plot shows scores (mean) of at least 100k training episodes
  
  Bonus
    (1) Describe the implementation and the usage of ùëõ-tuple network.
    (2) Explain the mechanism of TD(0). 
    (3) Describe your implementation in detail including action selection and TDbackup diagram

# HW2  Deep Q-Network (DQN)
